## Getting Started

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Docker** or **Podman** - For building and testing containers
- **Git** - For version control
- **NFS utilities** - For testing NFS functionality
  - Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install nfs-common`
  - RHEL/CentOS: `sudo yum install nfs-utils`
  - macOS: `brew install nfs-utils` (or use built-in NFS client)

### Development Environment Setup

1. **Fork and Clone**
   ```bash
   # Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/nfs-server-image.git
   cd nfs-server-image
   
   # Add upstream remote
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/sharedvolume/nfs-server-image.git
   ```

2. **Build the Development Image**
   ```bash
   docker build -t nfs-server:dev .
   ```

3. **Run Basic Tests**
   ```bash
   # Create test directory
   mkdir -p /tmp/nfs-test
   
   # Start container
   docker run -d --name nfs-dev --privileged \
     -v /tmp/nfs-test:/nfs \
     -e SHARED_DIRECTORY=/nfs \
     -p 2049:2049 \
     nfs-server:dev
   
   # Check container status
   docker logs nfs-dev
   docker exec nfs-dev showmount -e localhost
   
   # Cleanup
   docker stop nfs-dev && docker rm nfs-dev
   ```

## Making Changes

### Pull Request Process

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. **Create a Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/issue-description
   ```

2. **Make Your Changes**
   - Write clear, documented code
   - Follow existing code style and conventions
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation if needed

3. **Test Your Changes**
   - Ensure all existing tests pass
   - Add new tests for your changes
   - Test manually with different configurations

4. **Commit Your Changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature description"
   # or
   git commit -m "fix: resolve issue description"
   ```

5. **Push and Create Pull Request**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
   Then create a pull request on GitHub.

### Commit Message Guidelines

We follow conventional commit format:

- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

Examples:
- `feat: add support for multiple export directories`
- `fix: resolve permission issues in read-only mode`
- `docs: update installation instructions`

## Testing

## Testing

### Automated Testing

Run the test suite to ensure your changes don't break existing functionality:

```bash
# Basic functionality test
docker build -t nfs-server:test .
docker run -d --name nfs-test --privileged \
  -e SHARED_DIRECTORY=/tmp/test \
  nfs-server:test

# Wait for services to start
sleep 10

# Check logs for errors
docker logs nfs-test

# Verify NFS services are running
docker exec nfs-test pgrep -l rpc.mountd
docker exec nfs-test showmount -e localhost

# Cleanup
docker stop nfs-test && docker rm nfs-test
```

### Manual Testing

Test your changes with different configurations:

```bash
# Test read-only mode
docker run -d --name nfs-readonly --privileged \
  -v /tmp/test-data:/nfs \
  -e SHARED_DIRECTORY=/nfs \
  -e READ_ONLY=true \
  -p 2049:2049 \
  nfs-server:dev

# Test with client restrictions
docker run -d --name nfs-restricted --privileged \
  -v /tmp/test-data:/nfs \
  -e SHARED_DIRECTORY=/nfs \
  -e PERMITTED="192.168.1.0/24" \
  -p 2049:2049 \
  nfs-server:dev
```
